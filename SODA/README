# PROTOCOL

i) create a textfile that has a list of all files to download with wget
	soda3.4.1_5dy_ocean_or_original.txt
        
        NOTE: this file curently requests 5 day means 1980 - 2010 

1) acquire the SODA files:
	./get_soda_3.4.1.bash

        Function: wget files and subsets them to CCS region
        Returns:  .sub files

   i) check successful file download with:
        ./check_files

2) remove unnecessary variables from SODA files:
        ./edit_SODA3.4.1 

        Functions: 1) ncks -x -v 
                   2) ncatted
        Returns:   same file names (.sub)

3) make monthly means AND monthly climatology files:
        ./make_means

        Function: ncra across days then all months
        Returns:  1) soda3.4.1_mon_year_mon.nc files
                  2) soda3.4.1_1981-2010_clim_mon.nc files
 
        NOTE: script contains commented out code redundant with edit_SODA3.4.1
              AND sort_by_year.bash

   i) sanity check file time stamps of final monthly climatology files
        python check_dates.py

4) create gridfile for SODA remapping to ROMS:
	python make_SODA3_grid.py

        Returns: ROMS compatible SODA grid file

   i) check that SODA file works with pyroms:
        python SODA_grid_check.py

i) get_soda_3.4.1.bash

ii) ./make_means
    NOTE: contains the preliminary ncks to remove unused variables



#
# APR-24-2017
# ---------------------------------------------------
Re created boundary conditions so covered 1981 - 2010 (instead of 1980-2009)

used concat_cycle_bdry script to
1. concatonated the files: 
   ncrcat -O /glade/p/work/edrenkar/Inputs/construct/Boundary/bdry/CCS_bdry_soda3.3.1_1980-2009_clim* $filout
2. edited the time values:
   python edit_SODA_files.py:
          ' PYTHON SCRIPT GIST '
          ndays = [31,28,31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31]
          dtot=0
          newtime=np.zeros(len(ndays))
          '# establish sss_time values for cycling over 365d yr'
          '# (i.e., middle of Jan, Feb, Mar ... Dec)'
          for nmon in range(len(ndays)):
              newtime[nmon] = dtot + ndays[nmon]/2.0
              dtot+=ndays[nmon]
          fid.variables['time'].units = 'Days'
          fid.variables['time'][:] = newtime
3. cycled the time values:
   ncatted -O -a cycle_length,time,a,f,365 $filout

FOR OVERALL BOUNDARY PROGRESSION:
  + make means to get monthly clim for a given month
  + mv to Boundary folder
  + make bdry file
  + concat_cycle_bdry

CONCERN: IS IT REASONABLE TO ASSIGN SODA TIME VALUES TO CENTER
         OF MONTHS??

#
# MAR-17-2017 ::HAPPY ST. PATRICK'S DAY::
# -------------------------------------
Fixed CCS grid (forgot to truncate the xi_psi and xi_vert dimensions)

Removed excess variables, dimensions, attributes from monthly, initial, and clim SODA files:
   ncks -x -v hflux_total,nv,salt_flux_rstr,sbd,sbd_dhdt,sbd_horz,sbd_mld,sbd_vert,\
              st_edges_ocean,sw_edges_ocean,time_bounds \
           -d nv,st_edges_ocean,sw_edges_ocean \
              $file.nc $file.sub
   ncatted -O -a _FillValue,,d,, $file.sub $file.nc 
   rm $file.sub

#
# MAR-2-2017
# -------------------------------------
SODA files aquired and slabbed to CCS domain
 - 5dy, 1/4 deg files were: 
    1) extracted (wget)
    2) spatially truncated to CA (ncks)
    3) averaged into months (for year, for month, ncra soda$year$month*.nc)
    4) averaged 1980-2009 into monthly climatologyies (for month, ncra soday*$month.nc)
    5) concatenated into 1 clim file (ncrcat)
  
NEXT OBJECTIVES:
 - Convert into boundary condition and Climatology files
 - Attempt to get atmospheric files (ERA INTERIM)
 - CCMP Winds for daily/high resolution variability

#
# FEB-28-2017
# -------------------------------------
Switched to downloading higher resolution (quarter degree) SODA files
  - This exceeded the limit for my workspace directory
  - Edited wget file so extracted CCS domain immediately after download
  - Currently waiting to average them in to months

Questions to answer:
    Is generating monthly averages from 5dy means accepatble?
    # ART says alright - will check again later 
    What variables are missing (if any) to be ROMS-ready??

# FEB-27-2017
#-------------------------------------
Downloaded monthly mean values for SODA3.3.1 ocean variables
 - used bash script with wget and .txt file with list of files

Spatially truncated these files to the California Current System:
   ./spatial_shrink
   ncks -d latitude,180,255 -d longitude,430,503 soda3.3.1_mn_ocean_reg_$year.nc ../soda3.3.1_mn_ocean_CC_$year.nc

Averaged files by month and concatonated to generate 30yr (1980-2010) monthly climatology 
   ncra -O -F -d time,$mon,,12 soda3.3.1_mn_ocean_CC*.nc soda_$monstr.nc
   ncrcat soda_* soda3.3.1_mn_clim_$fyear-$lyear.nc

Questions to answer:
   HOW do these monthly averages compare with Rafs? 
   # CAME OUT PERSISTANTLY COOLER (or warmer, can't remember sign)
	i.e., would it have been better to generate my own monthly files from 5dy fields?
        # I AM NOW DOWNLOADING FROM THE ORIGINAL FILES B/C HIGHER RESOLUTION 
   HOW do I asign time values to them?
   # WITH 5dy means, seems they already have time stamps... will need to change perhaps
   WHAT needs to be done to get it ROMS ready?
   WHAT do we use for SODA grid for interpolation?
