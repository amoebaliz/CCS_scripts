# METHODS FOR CCMP FILE GENERATION
APR 25, 2017: ACQUISITION & PROCESSING

i)   ./get_CCMP_fils
     # CONDUCTED on YELLOWSTONE BECAUSE IT TOOK A LONG TIME
     wgets .nc files for 1988-2010
     spatial subset:
           ncks -d longitude,800,1100 -d latitude,300,600 $ncfil $ncfil.sub

ii)  ./make_means
     # CHANGE: only 1990-2010 because of missing data in 1988 & 1989
     ncra to get monthly mean in each year
     ncra to get 23 year climatology (1990-2010)
     ncrcat climatology files to get full year of monthly clims

iii) python make_anomalies.py
     calculate daily mean windfields from 6hrly fields
     subtract climatology month from daily mean
     create new anomaly file
     change longitude from 0to360 to -90to90 
     # SEPT 13, 2019
     change time to 'Days' (Subtract hours since X)

#      Daily anomaly files are created and stored @ 
#      /glade/p/work/edrenkar/external_data/CCMP

iv) python evaluate_wind_anoms.py
    generate stats on u v wind anomalies relative to 21yr clim for 
    CCMP sub_domain 

   # Inspect wind stats with
   1) evaluate_wind_anoms.py # generates stats file
   2) check_avg_anoms.py     # various stats plots

SEPT 8, 2017
v)  ./concat_daily_anoms
    generates daily anomaly files for each year - need to do manually 
    if not a complete JAN-DEC year

SEPT 13, 2019
v) ./concat_hrly_anoms
   generates hrly anomaly file
 
# MAY 15, 2018: DROWNING CCMP:
vi) ./get_ERAi_.25deg_grid.py
    CCMP does not appear to have a LSM. However, "it uses ERAi
    0.25 deg model wind fields as a first guess". So, assuming 
    CCMP shares the ERAi grid (may be inacurate but it's something).
    Need to use the ERAi .125deg LSM because CCMP is between falls
    between .25 grid coordinates
  
    RETURNS: ERAinterim_.125_lsm.nc

vii) python ERAi_LSM_2_CCMP.py
     Uses ESMF to interpolate ERAi .125deg grid to CCMP coordinates. 
     Also converts any very small values resulting from interpolation 
     to 0. Reverses land(ocean) = 1(0) to land(ocean) = 0(1)
 
     RETURNS: ERAi_CCMP_LSM.nc

viii) ./drown_CCMP_CLIM 
      Drowns CCMP wind anomalies using SOSIE and the above generated grid 
      removes valid_range, valid_min, valid_max attributes inserted by SOSIE

      RETURNS: drowned_CCMP_u_anom.nc
               drowned_CCMP_v_anom.nc

iv) python CCMP_2_ERAi.py
    Regrids CCMP to the ERAinterim grid and adds it to the ERAi wind field
    climatology    
 
    RETURNS: ERAi_CCMPanom_MAY01-APR02_Vwind.nc
             ERAi_CCMPanom_MAY01-APR02_Uwind.nc

# NOTE: LD 5-17-18: ISSUE WITH OLD FILES - have May 1 as first time step 
#       In composite wind files... so previously was using 4 month shift
#       In atmospheric vs. ocean fields..

# ISSUE FOUND:

# ORIGINAL CODE was CCMP_2_ROMS.py 

# for nmon in range(12):           # ITERATED OVER ALL MONTHS IN ERAi CLIM
#     md = nmon-(mon0-1)           # WHERE mon0 = MAY (5) for MAY 2001
#     nd = np.sum(ndays[:md])      # add number of days before beginning of nmon
#     for nt in range(ndays[md]):  # ITERATE OVER ALL DAYS IN nmon
#         n = nd + nt              # index for CCMP amonaly fields
#
#         ##ERROR##
#         Uout[n,:] = FinU[n,:].squeeze() + destfieldU.data
#         Vout[n,:] = FinV[n,:].squeeze() + destfieldV.data
#
# SHOULD NOT HAVE USED SAME INDEX 'n' FOR ?out VARIABLE. THIS MAINTAINS
# ORIGINAL CCMP ORERING. INSTEAT, SHOULD HAVE STARTED WITH COUNTER AT 0

REASON FOR FILE OMMISSIONS ON CCMP HOME PAGE:
"There are gaps within these data. There are 11 days scattered between May and December of 1988 and 14 days in January through July 1989 that do not appear on our FTP server

During this time period, F08 is the only operational satellite input into the dataset. Days that are missing are because there was either very little or no data collected by the satellite on that day.

In future reprocessing, we may include these files for completeness, but the CCMP wind field would essentially be just the ERA-Int background except for minor differences near buoys."

CHOOSING to use 21 yr clim (omit 1988 and 1989) in part bc patch and in part bc not sure where all missing files are...
